            <h1>Design Principle: Visual Hierarchy</h1>
            <h2>bestbuy</h2>
            <h2><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com">Bestbuy</a><h2>
            <img src="images/bestbuy.jpg" alt="bestbuy Homepage">
            <p>The Rule of Visual Hierarchy rank things inside a web page according the importance that 
                it has on the site and what we want to transmit others. In this case as any other site 
                of sales online we have here a big eye catcher and the most important texts are placed 
                in specifically.

            <h1>Design Principle: Hick’s Law</h1>
            <h2>Little Caesars</h2>
            <h2><a href="https://littlecaesars.com/en-us/">Little Caesars</a><h2>
            <img src="images/little.jpg" alt="Little Caesars Homepage">
            <p>
                The Rule of Hick’s Law increase the number of choices that we can make in this case food. 
                The principle says that when more choices you give, the easier it is to choose nothing, because
                 in this case the user has more difficulty. Basically, web designers make their sites the easier 
                 they can for understanding.

            <h1>Design Principle: White space</h1>
            <h2>Whirlpool </h2>
            <h2><a href="https://www.whirlpool.com/kitchen/refrigeration.html">Whirlpool</a><h2>
            <img src="images/whirlpool.jpg" alt="Whirlpool Homepage">
            <p> White space is called also negative space because it has big gaps that gives a clear 
                impression. We are using here an example of this site where you find refrigerator. 
                It needs to keep that impression because of the product they are offer. They are communicating their message pretty clear and is easier understand their purpose.
